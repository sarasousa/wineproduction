 <div align="center">

          <p class="lead info" align="justify">There are various stages of the grapevine growth cycle of is crucial for production; each has different demands regarding multiple conditions, such as temperature or humidity. <br>
On the subject of vine maintenance, it is necessary to use condition the vineyard with specific chemical products in order to protect the grapes from illness, products adapted according to grape variety and weather. Services such as warnings and e-mail newsletters exist solely to notify farmers of potential future dangers and provide guidance on how to protect their production fields. <br>
The <strong>Vinho Verde</strong> production process, while mostly similar to the other wine production processes in the world, differs interestingly in how the vines are grown in particular parts of the region. The final grape variety is grafted on a host vine, which grants it better growth conditions. Another peculiar aspect of the wine from this region is that it is naturally carbonated. A side effect of this characteristic is a cloudy appearance. To handle this, some products are used, but they also remove some of the natural gas, so, at times, artificially gasification is employed. <br>
The <strong>Alto Douro</strong> vineyard region is officially defined as a wine production region in Portugal. Instituted during the XVIII century, the evolution of the territory continued with notoriety even today. For years the landscape changed from a natural slope craved by the Douro River, to an artificial downhill steppe with wine terraces that provide the environment needed for the growth of more than 200 hectares of vineyards. This landscape human-sculptured landscape became part of the World Heritage by UNESCO in 2001. </p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading" >Vine mildew</h2>
          <p class="lead">The vine mildew (Plasmopara viticola) is perhaps the most significant disease in vineyard, causing widespread damage. The fungus endures winter in the form of structures called oospores, located in fallen leaves and or directly on the soil. The so called “three ten rule” (temperature above 10ºC, rainfall at a minimum of 10mn for 24 to 48 hours, shoots with at least 10cm of growth) determines the optimal conditions for proliferation of this disease.<br>
All green organs of the plant are prone to contracting this disease (leaves, blossoms, grapes and shoots). Its presence can be verified by the appearance of oily stains on the upper side of the leaves, white felt on their underside and even mosaic mottled patterns on the leaves.</p>

          <p class="lead">Escoriose is an illness that can affect the grapevine plant from the earliest stages of the cultivation process, potentially causing significant losses in production. The fungus responsible for the illness is most active during winter. It can be identified due to the formation of resilient structures, “picnídeos” in Portuguese, and black dots which are visible to the naked eye. These contain spores that mature during winter and eventually proliferate, infecting plant’s green organs. High humidity (7 a 10 hours per day) and typical spring temperatures (15ºC to 18ºC) are favourable conditions for the emergence and spread of the malady.</p>

<div class="main-title">Deficiencies</div>


 <div align="center">
        <div class="row featurette">
          <p class="lead info" align="justify">In Portugal, approximately 80% of the soils are of acidic nature. This is one of the most restrictive factors concerning Portuguese agriculture, as it hinders the amount of nitrogen oxide present in the soil, blocking the solution of phosphorus, provoking aluminium toxicity, blocking the mineralization of organic matter and promoting calcium and magnesium deficiencies.<br>
Due to this, it is imperative to balance the absence of certain elements on the soil; if lacking, these can negatively influence the development and growth of the vineyards and, consequently, the quality of the wine itself.</p>
